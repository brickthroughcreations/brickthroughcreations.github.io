To celebrate International Lego Day, I made a version of one of my newest sets: [Flower Bouquet 10280](https://www.lego.com/en-ca/product/flower-bouquet-10280). I love this set, but since I didn't have a vase, I needed to find a solution to display these wonderful flowers.

Instead of building a vase, I opted to mount the flowers to a wall of bricks. The result can be mounted on a wall or stood up like in the first picture. It can also be laid flat as in the second picture to display on a desk or shelf.

Here's what the brick wall layer looks like:

I used one of the pterodactyl wing pieces to add as a leaf and otherwise I just slotted the flowers from the set into the Technic and SNOT pieces in the brick wall layer. I played around with spacing of the pieces until the flowers fit the arrangement I wanted. 

I'm happy with the result but would love to make a larger display. Time to collect more bricks!
