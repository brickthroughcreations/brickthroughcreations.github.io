To celebrate International Lego Day, I made a version of one of my newest sets: <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-ca/product/flower-bouquet-10280">Flower Bouquet 10280</a>. I love this set, but since I didn’t have a vase, I needed to find a solution to display these wonderful flowers.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/flower-bouquet-desk-display.jpg" alt="Custom Flower Bouquet Desk Display" />
Instead of building a vase, I opted to mount the flowers to a wall of bricks. The result can be mounted on a wall or stood up like in the first picture. It can also be laid flat as in the second picture to display on a desk or shelf.</p>

<p>Here’s what the brick wall layer looks like:</p>

<p>I used one of the pterodactyl wing pieces to add as a leaf and otherwise I just slotted the flowers from the set into the Technic and SNOT pieces in the brick wall layer. I played around with spacing of the pieces until the flowers fit the arrangement I wanted.</p>

<p>I’m happy with the result but would love to make a larger display. Time to collect more bricks!</p>
